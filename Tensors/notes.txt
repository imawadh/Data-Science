ndim --> to know the number of dimensional of a tensor 

axis = dimension = rank --> axis, dimension and rank of tensor are same ...  


In NumPy, "ndim" and shape are both attributes of a NumPy array, but they describe different aspects:

ðŸ”¹ ndim: Number of Dimensions
This gives you the number of dimensions (axes) of the array.
It's an integer.

Example:

import numpy as np

a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(a.ndim)  # Output: 2
This means a is a 2-dimensional array.

ðŸ”¹ shape: Size Along Each Dimension
This returns a tuple of integers, each representing the size of the array along a particular dimension.

Example:

print(a.shape)  # Output: (2, 3)
This tells you that the array has 2 rows and 3 columns.
